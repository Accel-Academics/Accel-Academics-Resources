## What Is Accel Academics

Accel Academics as said above is a game site project that aims to bypass web filters while maintaining open-source principles. This means that there will be infrequent updates bringing games, and patches to existing games more often.

---

### Main Principles

**Quality over quantity** is very important for the simple reason that we don't want to be posting games of low quality or rushed releases where it's broken/buggy and it results in multiple patches to get it to a usable state. This will result in releases of new games less frequent and patches to fix bugs on an as-needed basis.

Another very important thing is **open-sourcing** as much as possible. There will be few assets on the site that are closed-sourced. The things that would be kept behind closed doors are certain exploits/bypasses we want to keep under wraps to prevent them from being patched.

---

## Ads? (Not yet)

To put it simply, we would like to make some amount of money for the 150+ hours invested into making this website. It doesn't feel right not getting anything in return for all the work we've put into Accel Academics. I'm sorry for the ads and we do plan on implementing a way to go ad-free for some form of payment. (As of right now, there are no ads on the site so don't worry)
